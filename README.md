# XACML Consent example IG

To satisfy [FHIR-48988 - Consent using XACML example](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48988) and explore how XACML policies can be used with FHIR Consent resources.

- ci-build for FHIR R6 - https://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/xacml-consent/branches/R6/index.html

## Status

This is a trial IG to explore using XACML policies for FHIR Consent resources.

The solution is not as clear as it should be. I filed [FHIR-53724 - Consent policyRule is missing](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-53724) to address issues found.
